## Horiseon Social Solutions Services Code Refraction Project
Horiseon Social Solutions Services is the tool that all businesses need to transition from just being a good business, to being a great business.

The mission statement of Horiseon is to take their clients from a 20th century Mom and Pop, to a 21 century juggernaut. In a world of technology; web presence is manditory. It is the difference between having a line out door, with customers eager to do business; or, you barely keeping the lights on and paying your staffs wages.

Horiseon is the one-stop shop for a business that is in need of marketing solutions; a greater social meadia presence; and lead generation.
With Horisean; a business can gain the necessary quantitative data their business needs to not only scale, but thrive.

## Description of the project
The main objective of this project is to make Horiseon's web application universally useable by their clients. It is very possible that a client could have a vision disability or some other impairment that restricts their use of web technology. 

The purpose of accessibility is to add code to a web app, that aids in the ability for persons with handicaps to access the web app; while not reducing the experiences of someone who does not have an impairment. 

In this repository; Horiseon has provided the original code; our task is to make it organized, less bulky, and accessible for people with impairments. 

## Why Horiseon, and why this project
Horisean is on the leader board, in the Digital Marketing and Lead Generation space. Their products and services should be accessible by all, who wish to utilize it. A physical disability should not be the contributing factor to the prevention of someone gaining access, and utilizing a web application. This project is ethically, the write thing to do. 

Another reason why this project should be undertook, is because of the Scouts Rule. This web application needs work. As a web developer, representing the skill set, we take pride in our craft. If we know there is work to be done, the desire to take on the challenge, should motivate us to resolve the issue.

## What I have done to this Web App
The first thing that I did was add Meta Data, so Horiseon's site would be hooked during key word and description searches online. I changed the syntax in HTML and CSS, to be more senamatic. I also added alt's to the image tags: this allows screen readers to give a description of what an image is or represents. 

In the CSS file I changed the format of my selectors. I also grouped selectors that have identical attributes, which substantially reduce lines of code.

## What this project can do for you
I feel that this project not only fulfill an individuals need to help; it also brings the chance for a professional to grow their expertise. With a project like this attached to your resume, the professional not only gets a chance to show they are ethical as a person, but they are technical and aware of current laws and market standards.
